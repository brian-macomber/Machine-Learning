### HW3 - Nearest Neighbor Classification

The idea of this homework assignment was to implement k nearest neighbor classification on a sample data set given.
The algorithm is run using k = 1, k = 5, and k = 10 to show how the ccr changes and the best value for k is dependent on the data given.

### HW4 - K-means CLustering

### HW5 - LDA

### HW6 - PCA

### HW7 - Subgradient Descent Algorithm

### HW8 - Multi-Class NN Classification
